## Overview and Origin



Overbond was founded in 2015<sup>[1](https://www.linkedin.com/company/overbond/about/) </sup> by Vuk Magdelinic, Han Ryoo and Abdul Haseeb<sup>[2](https://www.marsdd.com/news/humansofmars-overbond-digitizing-bond-issuance-process/)</sup>.

Han and Vuk meet on the fixed income trading floor at CIBC Capital Markets.<sup>[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhYkZ2vXFHQ)</sup> It appears Abdul Haseeb was brought in as a technologist, to develop the initial platform. As his time with the company was fairly short-lived from Feb 2016 - Oct 2016.<sup>[4](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdulhaseebab/)</sup>
 Overbond raised $7.5 mil(CA) in seed financing round in June 2016. Lead by Morrison Financial Services<sup>[5](https://www.cantechletter.com/2016/06/primary-bond-market-fintech-company-overbond-raises-7-5-million-seed-round/)</sup>

 Having worked in a traditional financial institution, it is likely that Han and Vuk witnessed firsthand the inefficiencies in Primary Bond issuance. In the bond market, brokers still take orders manually over the phone or by email, one at a time, which they keep track of on spreadsheets. 
 In Overbond's estimate Canadian dealers and issuers spend **125,000** hours managing the receipt of more than 2.3 million bond market updates by email, a problem which is an order of magnitude worse in the United States.<sup>[5](https://www.cantechletter.com/2016/06/primary-bond-market-fintech-company-overbond-raises-7-5-million-seed-round/)</sup>

## Business Activities:
*For the past fifty years, the process of corporations raising money in the bond market hasn’t changed much. Bankers and corporations call each other and send individual files, one at a time, over and over again. The medium has changed — faxes turned into emails — but the core concept hasn’t. Considering that bond origination is a multi-trillion-dollar industry, it must be asked: isn’t there a better way?*

*On average, Canadian dealers and issuers exchange over 2.3 million bond pricing emails every year, each with individually created files. Consequently, these tasks require hundreds of thousands of hours of labour every year — labour that, in an era of information efficiency, could be better spent. “It’s a mind-blowing problem.” says Overbond’s co-founder Vuk Magdelinic.*<sup>[6](https://www.news.overbond.com/changing-face-worlds-largest-capital-market/)</sup>

Overbond looks to modernizes all aspects of bond origination. By providing secure communications, real-time market updates, and custom reporting and analytics, while reducing infrastructure and transaction costs for issuers, dealers, and investors.<sup>[7](https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/overbond-launches-the-first-end-to-end-platform-for-primary-bond-origination/)</sup>

The Primary target audience for Overbond are the large Buy-side and Sell-side institutions that operate in the primary bond market. This market continues to grow and diversify.<sup>[8](https://www.clearstream.com/resource/blob/1316810/8b0028c00930f4cc551c948fb2932e4f/aiteissuance-pdf-data.pdf)</sup>

<br/><br/>

Currently, Overbond appears to hold the first mover advantage in the space. Historically the Primary Bond space has been resistant to change, due to complexities associated with the transactions. Provided Overbond can continue to leverage the relationships it has built, it should continue to find success and gain sticky market share. Typically once a product becomes ingrained on both the Buy and Sell side, adoption of competitors products become difficult. (Bloomberg vs Reuters/Refinitiv)

## Landscape:

The Bond market has always been the domain of large institutional players. From the companies/countries seeking capital, the banks that manage the origination through to the financial institutions the ultimately purchase the bonds.

The last 10 years have seen innovations in the structures of the bonds themselves. With products like Green bonds gaining traction.<sup>[9](https://www.climatebonds.net/market/explaining-green-bonds)</sup> However, the market itself and the origination process has largely remained unchanged. With the large institutions involved relying on manual communication and data entry. Overbond's offering provides a breath of fresh air in a stale industry.

While Overbond retains a first mover advantage. It is potentially competing with the 800 pound gorillas of the finance industry. The 2 obvious competitors are Bloomberg and Refintiv. Bloomberg especially, is heavily embedded in the companies that Overbond will be targeting as customers. The key advantage the Overbond has, is that it is working within a smaller ecosystem. The other players having larger products that are historically slower to adapt.




## Results

To date Overbond's impact in the market appear to be fairly minor. With some market participants utilizing their services. 

Given the opacity in bond market. It may be hard to monitor Overbond's success. The best metric may be the continued existence of the company, the employee count continuing to grow and the company releasing new products.

The likely path for Overbond and it's competitor is likely to be fraught. Once a particular platform reaches a critical mass of market participants, it is likely the rest of the market will adopt the platform as a standard. Overbond's advantage is that there is not significant competition in space to date.



## Recommendations

Overbond has continued to diversify its product offerings. With the company releasing a Real-Time AI Bond Pricing product earlier this year.<sup>[9](https://aithority.com/technology/analytics/overbond-achieves-real-time-ai-bond-pricing-utilizing-latest-aws-serverless-cloud-infrastructure/)</sup> To find further success outside of developing additional products, Overbond should look to integrate with the Refinitiv or Bloomberg platforms. Given those companies dominance in the space. 

By integrating with a market leader, Overbond's products would find their way to trading desks across the industry. It would also provide a solid exit strategy for the founders and equity holders of the company. This path of action would be recommended as it would allow Overbond to leverage it's first mover advantage, prior to facing significant competition from well capitialised players. 

If Overbond wanted to remain independent. One strategy it could pursue, would be utilising it's platform to provide access to the capital markets for smaller players. This could be a successful strategy given the growth in private debt in the last decade.

By targeting smaller businesses that wish to access capital markets and Private lenders. Overbond could open itself up to a growing market with less sophisticated competition.
